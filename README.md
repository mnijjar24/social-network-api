## Social Network API

## Welcome to the Social Network API

The objective of create the Social Network API is so as a social media startup, there can be an API that uses a NOSQL database so that the associated website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. This being said, in this application, when a command is entered to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. Furthermore, when the API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts are opened, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia are tested, then the user is successfully able to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in their database. Lastly, when API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia are tested, then the user is able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list. Overall, this application is great and convinent for a social media startup to use!
